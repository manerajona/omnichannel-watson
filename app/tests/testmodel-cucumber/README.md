# Testing the AI model with Cucumber

To automate the test cases we use the BDD framework *Cucumber*. The official Cucumber library for Golang is "godog" (https://github.com/cucumber/godog). 

This framework merges the test specification and documentation into a .feature file, applying our test scenarios. The .feature files are written using the Cucumber language called "Gherkin", in the Given, When, Then format.
